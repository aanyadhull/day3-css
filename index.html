The different media types include all, print, screen and speech.<br>

    all - works for all devices
    print - works for devices where the media is in print preview mode
    screen - works for devices with screens
    speech - works for devices like screen readers where the content is read out loud to the user</h3>
    <h2>6.Write a code to show any animation examples</h2>
    <h3>An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

        You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times as you want.
        
        To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.
        
        Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.<br>
        The animation-direction property can have the following values:<br>

        normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default<br>
        reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)<br>
        alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards<br>
        alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards
    <br>The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.

    The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:<br>
    
    ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)<br>
    linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end<br>
    ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start<br>
    ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end<br>
    ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end<br>
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function</h3>
